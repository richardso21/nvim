*"how do i quit vim O_o"* - richardso21

Nothing too flashy, just something that kinda matches the vscode vibe while
also being magnitudes faster. I realized that configs like lazyvim and their 3
gazillion preset plugins and keybinds infuriate me more than they help. My
config ended up like 75% of lazyvim anyways, but nonetheless I stand my ground.

See `after/plugin/whichkey.lua` for my preferred keyboard shortcuts.
