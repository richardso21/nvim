# richardso21/nvim

This is my (richardso21's) personal Neovim config, made completely from
scratch (not even kickstart.nvim). My journey began when I watched
[ThePrimeagen's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE).

Nothing too flashy, just something that kinda matches the VSCode vibe while
also being magnitudes faster (_a "good enough" 50ms startup time on a new
project/directory_). Presets like LazyVim and their gazillion (opinionated)
configs infuriate me more than they help. My config ended up being ~75% of
LazyVim anyway, nonetheless I stand my ground.
